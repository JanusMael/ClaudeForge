|---|---|
| Branch | `feat/agentforge-opencodeforge` |
| HEAD | the `docs:` commit carrying this file — `git log -1`. The last **functional** commit is `6e5352b`, *feat(14): OpenCodeForge's disk-footprint page, and the flag that proves it renders* |
| Working tree | clean |
| Unpushed | **23 commits**, this file's included (`git rev-list --count @{u}..HEAD` — trust that over this cell). Nothing pushed; **no PR** (`gh pr list --head feat/agentforge-opencodeforge` is empty) |
| Suite | **4,266 passed · 0 failed · 11 skipped**, Debug (was 4,245 — the 21 new ones are listed below) |
| Trim check | Release `win-x64` publish clean for **both** apps, zero ILLink warnings |
| ✅ Verified | **Both new pages have now been SEEN rendered**, driven by `--deep-link` against the published build. The long-standing verification gap is closed — see *Verification* below |

## ▶ RESUME HERE — Phase 14 is complete; pick the next phase

**Phase 14 is done and committed.** Its last item — the disk-footprint page — is built, tested,
and has been *seen rendered* on the published build.

The open work is Phase 15+ in [`docs/OPENCODEFORGE-PLAN.md`](docs/OPENCODEFORGE-PLAN.md), plus the
small items under *Known issues*. **Nothing is blocking**, and nothing is half-finished.

### ⭐ New capability worth knowing about before anything else

**A page in these apps can now be looked at.** `scripts/capture-page.ps1` launches a *published*
app, deep-links to one node, photographs the window and shuts it down:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/capture-page.ps1 `
    -ExePath src/OpenCodeForge/bin/Release/net10.0/win-x64/publish/OpenCodeForge.exe `
    -NodeId footprint -OutFile footprint.png
```

⛔ **Use it on every new page before calling one done.** The headless test app is stripped of the
App's resource dictionaries and cannot instantiate views, so a page can pass every test, publish
trimmed with zero warnings, and still be blank — which is the exact state the Backup page sat in for
a phase. ⚠ Windows only, and the capture is a *screen* grab: an overlapping window lands in the PNG
and reads like clipped layout, so check the window rectangle the script prints. `PrintWindow` is not
the fix and was already tried — see the script's own comment.

⛔ **Phase 16's quantitative half still gates the footprint page's RATES, not the page.**
`usage.isUsedInstall` in `docs/opencode-install-probe.json` still reads `false`, so growth, retention
and prune rates remain unmeasurable. Current sizes are live and correct.

---

## Done — 2026-09-12, second batch

Phase 14's last item, plus the flag that made it verifiable and the defect that finding it exposed.
Three commits:

| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| `765648a` | ⛔⛔ **Defect:** `OpenCodeClient` and `OpenCodeTuiClient` never supplied their own `FootprintService`, so `AgentConfigClientCore`'s default gave them **Claude's seven `~/.claude` categories**. `GetFootprintStatsAsync` returned real rows over real directories belonging to the other agent, and `DeleteFootprintCategoryAsync` would have deleted them. Both constructors now pass `OpenCodeFootprint.Catalog` and the `Roots` **method group**. Guard: `OpenCodeClientFootprintTests` — 5 tests, 4 of which fail against the pre-fix tree, verified by stashing the fix rather than assumed |
| `6e5352b` | ⭐ **The footprint page** — `OpenCodeFootprintViewModel` + `OpenCodeFootprintRowViewModel`, `Views/FootprintView.axaml` (+ code-behind), an `App.axaml` template, a `footprint` nav node, 21 resx keys, 16 wiring tests. ⭐ **Plus `--deep-link <nodeId>`**, in the same commit because `MainWindowViewModel` carries both halves: applied *after* the landing page is set so an unresolvable id leaves a working window, searching top-level nodes and their children and expanding a matched child's parent |
| `a429603` | **The harness** — `scripts/capture-page.ps1`. See *RESUME HERE* |

⚠ **Bisectability.** `765648a` is SDK-only and was built and tested alone before any app change
existed — its five tests passed against `src/OpenCode.Sdk` on its own. `6e5352b` is the state the
full build and 4,266-test run were taken against. `a429603` adds no compiled code.

**Three deliberate divergences from ClaudeForge's memory page**, each asserted in markup because an
omission cannot be observed from a running view-model: **no `DataGrid`** (it brings click-to-sort,
and a size sort inverts the page's guidance), **no delete button**, **no ancestor bindings**.

⛔ **Why there is no delete button.** The catalog's order *is* prune guidance, so the temptation is
to let the user act on it in place. Against it: the regeneration and retention behaviour of every
category is explicitly unmeasured (Phase 16), one row is in no backup at all and has no undo, and
`node_modules` is live state for a running agent. Reveal hands the folder to the file manager, which
asks its own question. **Re-opening this needs Phase 16's measurements, not an argument.**

⛔ **A fourth instance of the session's one shape.** The three earlier defects were a *write* path
resolving through a different function than every read path. This one is the same shape on a **read**
path — which is why no archive and no measurement caught it, and why it survived a whole phase with
its catalog sitting there tested and unused. **A product's data existing is not evidence that
anything consumes it.**

---

## Done — 2026-09-12, first batch

Eight commits, all on `feat/agentforge-opencodeforge`, none pushed. In order:

| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| `6968ae1` | `TipCell` moves `ClaudeForge.Controls` → `LayeredEditors.Avalonia.Controls`; six ClaudeForge views follow it. The two products cannot reference each other, so the alternative was a second copy |
| `040d26b` | ⛔ **Defect:** the shared credentials prompt hardcoded `~/.claude/.credentials.json`. Now `BackupPageOptions.CredentialsPathDisplay`, `required` like its siblings, so a third host is a compile error until it answers |
| `1634a4d` | ⭐ **OpenCodeForge's Backup / Restore page** — host options record, view + code-behind, `App.axaml` template, nav node, persisted state, 104 resx keys, 12 wiring tests. `OpenCodeBackup` went `internal` → `public` |
| `24fc550` | docs: the anchor catches up with its own commits |
| `820a098` | docs: the redirected-config defect, measured with a throwaway canary |
| `86bee98` | ⛔⛔ **Defect:** a redirected config backed up to an EMPTY archive that reported success. Now `config/` ← `GlobalDirectory(env)` plus `config-default/` ← the default root when they differ, gated by a new `ProductArchiveSection.IncludeWhen` |
| `9883518` | docs: the twin survey — five `DefaultGlobalDirectory()` call sites, one of them a live bug |
| `15af56a` | ⛔ **Defect:** that twin — `OpenCodeFootprint.Roots()` measured the wrong config root. Fixed and guarded |

**Three defects, one shape.** All three were *a write path resolving through a different function
than every read path*. Worth holding as a pattern rather than three incidents: when a product
exposes `X()` and `DefaultX()`, anything that WRITES or MEASURES must justify which one it uses.

### Bisectability — checked, not assumed

`6968ae1`, `040d26b` and `1634a4d` were each rebuilt at their own commit in a detached worktree.
All three build alone; `040d26b` runs the pre-change suite green at 4,227, so the +12 arrive with
the page rather than with the defect fix underneath it.

### Verification — the gap is closed, and here is exactly how far

✅ **Both pages have been seen rendered**, in the published `win-x64` build, driven by
`--deep-link` through `scripts/capture-page.ps1`.

- **Footprint page:** six rows in catalog order against OpenCode's own four roots, measured on a
  real install — `node_modules` 3,667 files / 52.4 MB at the top, `opencode.db` 3 files / 277.5 KB
  at the bottom carrying its *Cannot be regenerated* badge, total line `58.8 MB across 6
  categories`. This is also the observation that proves the defect fix end to end: the rows are
  under `~/.config/opencode`, `~/.cache/opencode` and `~/.local/...`, not `~/.claude`.
- **Backup page:** renders with exactly two scope radios, no MSIX tab, both client checkboxes, and
  no unreadable light-mode banner — the three deliberate divergences, confirmed visually rather
  than only by markup scan.

⚠ **Still NOT observed, and unchanged by this session: no backup has been taken or restored through
the GUI.** The round trip is covered at the SDK level by `OpenCodeBackupRoundTripTests` and
`OpenCodeRedirectedConfigBackupTests`; what remains unproven is the path from a button to it. The
harness navigates and photographs — it presses nothing.

⚠ **One cosmetic thing seen and then ruled out.** The footprint page's *Re-measure* button reads as
disabled at a glance. It is not: `IsBusy` is false and `RefreshCommand.CanExecute` is true after a
completed walk, both now asserted in `TheTotalCountsEveryCategory_IncludingTheEmptyOnes`. It is the
Semi Dark secondary-button fill against the blue-texted Reveal buttons beside it. Worth a style
pass, not a fix.

## 🔒 Locked decisions — do not relitigate

- **The footprint page renders CATALOG order and offers no sort.** The order is the page's only
  real guidance and it is the inverse of a size sort: the largest row regenerates from
  `package.json`, the smallest meaningful one is the only irreplaceable thing on the page. A
  `DataGrid` brings click-to-sort by default, which is why the page uses an `ItemsControl` and why
  `TheViewOffersNoDeleteAndNoSort` scans for both.
- **The footprint page does not delete.** See *Done* for the three reasons. Re-opening it needs
  Phase 16's measurements.
- **Every OpenCode client supplies its own `FootprintService`.** `AgentConfigClientCore`'s default
  is Claude's catalog, and a product client that does not override it reports the other agent's
  files as its own. Both OpenCode clients pass the same catalog on purpose — `tui.json` lives
  inside the config root, so the TUI's footprint *is* OpenCode's.
- **`tests/AgentForge.Core.Tests/Fixtures/*.zip` are frozen.** Never re-mint one to make a test
  pass. A change that cannot restore one needs a migration, or a *second* fixture beside it.
- **A host that backs up a product must also be able to restore it** — same set to
  `BackupRequest.Products` and `new BackupEngine(restorableProducts:)`. OpenCodeForge passes
  `OpenCodeBackup.Engine`; `BackupEngine.Default` restores Claude's two and nothing else.
- **`ProductArchiveSection.IncludeWhen` is consulted by the WRITER only.** What a restore may apply
  is decided by what is in the archive: the machine reading it need not have the environment of the
  machine that wrote it.
- **OpenCodeForge's Backup view offers two scope radios and no MSIX tab**, and uses no literal
  colours. All three are deliberate divergences from ClaudeForge's copy, each guarded by a markup
  scan in `OpenCodeBackupWiringTests` because an omission cannot be observed from a running VM.
- **The footprint's config root is ONE root**, unlike the backup's two — the backup carries both
  because both hold user-authored config, while the only footprint category against that root is a
  regenerable cache. Re-opening this needs a *measurement* of a redirected install, not an argument.
- **`BackupMode` stays an enum** and cannot move to `AgentForge.Abstractions` (BCL-only by design).
  That is why `ProductSkippedSubdir.IncludedInFullBackup` is a bool rather than a mode name.
- **No second resx in the shell.** Hosts supply wording via `BackupPageText`.
- **OpenCodeForge's resx is English-only and declared so** — `ResxLedger` in
  `LocalizationParityTests` carries `("OpenCodeForge", false, …)`, and contracts #1–#4 run only
  against `src/ClaudeForge/Localization`. ⚠ Declaring this project *localized* is what would force
  #1–#4 to be generalised first.
- **OpenCode's config root is archived whole**, letting OpenCode's own `.gitignore` exclude the
  52 MiB `node_modules` — never a hardcoded skip list. Two earlier plan drafts got that list wrong.
- **`opencode.db` is opt-in with an advisory, never redacted**, and excluded from `Sanitized`
  outright. `auth.json` is never archived at all.
- **No AI attribution trailers on commits**, per the global `CLAUDE.md`. That decision outranks a
  session instruction mandating one; the 18 commits on this branch carry none.

## Known issues / debt

Newest first.

- ⚠ **`AGENTS.md`'s "adding a debug flag" checklist describes ClaudeForge's parser, and the two
  apps disagree on the one rule that matters.** That list says a two-token flag consumes its value
  with `args[++i]` unconditionally; OpenCodeForge's `DebugFlags` documents and implements the
  opposite — **flags PEEK, they do not consume**, so every argument still reaches Avalonia. Both are
  right for their own app, and the checklist names `src/ClaudeForge/Services/DebugFlags.cs`
  explicitly, so nothing is wrong today. ⚠ It is one careless copy away from being wrong: `--deep-link`
  was added here following this app's rule, not the checklist's. Left alone deliberately —
  `AGENTS.md` rows are guard-test-backed and generalising this one is its own change.
- ⓘ **The footprint page's *Re-measure* button reads as disabled.** Cosmetic; proven enabled. See
  *Verification*.
- ⓘ **`FootprintService.GetProjectTranscriptStatsAsync` stays Claude-shaped on an OpenCode client.**
  It walks `~/.claude/projects` through `ClaudeArtifactPaths` regardless of catalog, so it is the
  one footprint member the catalog fix does NOT make product-correct. Nothing calls it from
  OpenCodeForge and the new page does not, but it is the same latent lie the catalog defect was —
  a read path that answers confidently for the wrong product. Fixing it means either a per-product
  seam or making it throw on a non-default catalog; both are decisions, not cleanups.
- ⚠ **The `OpenCode TUI` checkbox archives nothing of its own.** `OpenCodeProducts.Tui` carries no
  `BackupLayout`; `tui.json` travels anyway inside the config root. Ticking it changes only the
  archive's `manifest.clients` and which schema is bundled. Listing it is still right — it starts
  working the day the product gains a layout — but the checkbox promises more than it delivers.
- ⚠ **A restore does not reload the open documents.** ClaudeForge passes `OnRestoreCompleted`,
  `IsAnyWorkspaceDirty` and `SaveAllWorkspaces` into the shared page; OpenCodeForge's window has no
  save-all pipeline to wire them to, so they are unset. The editor keeps showing the pre-restore
  file until the app is restarted.
- ⓘ **The two-roots survey.** Five `DefaultGlobalDirectory()` call sites in `src/`: one is the
  fallback inside `GlobalDirectory` itself; two — `OpenCodeArtifactSources.AddGlobalSources` and
  `OpenCodeEssentialsViewModel.HasShadowedGlobalRules` — already handle both roots deliberately and
  are the precedent the backup fix followed; the fifth was the footprint bug, now fixed. ⚠ Both
  correct sites compare with an unconditional `OrdinalIgnoreCase` where the backup's new
  `SameDirectory` asks the real OS. On Linux two roots differing only in case would read as one
  there. Vanishingly unlikely; on the record rather than silently inconsistent.
- ⚠ **`DisplayClients` does not abbreviate OpenCode's product names.**
  `BackupRowViewModel.AbbreviateClient` maps `claudecode`/`claudedesktop` and passes anything else
  through, so the Clients column renders `OpenCode+OpenCodeTui` in a 110 px cell. Verbose rather
  than wrong — the passthrough was designed for it — and the tooltip carries the full text.
- ⓘ **Three accessible names on the Backup page are formatted in markup**, not resx —
  `{Binding DisplayName, StringFormat='{}{0} — Restore'}` and two siblings. Carried over from
  ClaudeForge, which has the same three, so the two apps at least agree.
- ⓘ **ClaudeForge's `BackupRestoreView.axaml` declares a `BytesToHumanReadableConverter` resource it
  never uses.** Noticed while porting; left alone.
- ⚠ **Unlocalised strings moved, not introduced.** Progress labels on `ProductArchiveSection` and
  the restore advisory in `RestoreEngine` are English literals. They should be keyed by section id
  the way footprint labels are keyed by `FootprintCategory.Id`. ⚠ This session added one more:
  `"Restoring the default opencode config root…"`.
- ⚠ **`WithNoNetwork_BothSectionsSayBundled` flaked once** on 2026-09-11, then passed in isolation,
  in its own assembly, and in every full run since. Cause unknown; not reproducible on demand.
- ⛔ **Phase 16's quantitative half stays blocked.** `usage.isUsedInstall` is still `false`, so
  growth, retention and prune *rates* are unmeasurable.
- ⓘ **The local OpenCode install stays contaminated** from an earlier session: three
  `opencode debug v2` runs fetched `models.json` and ripgrep and left two empty
  `~/.cache/opencode/bin/ripgrep-*` temp dirs. Deleting them is a user decision.
- ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-09-12** — `CLAUDE.md`'s "builds ClaudeForge only" line was indeed stale.
  Verified against `publish.ps1`'s own `-App` parameter (which documents `-App OpenCodeForge`) and
  against `.github/workflows/`, which carries both `release.yml` and `release-opencodeforge.yml`.
  The paragraph is corrected and carries a dated note saying what it used to claim.
